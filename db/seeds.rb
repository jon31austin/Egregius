You already know\nWho's fully capable, the two caped heroes\nDial straight down the center, eight-zero-zero\nYou can even call collect, the most feared duet\nSince me and Elton played career Russian Roulette\nAnd never even see me blink or get to bustin' a sweat\nPeople steppin' over people just to rush to the set\nJust to get to see an MC who breathes so freely\nEase over these beats and be so breezy\nJesus, how can shit be so easy?\nHow can one Chandra be so Levy?\nTurn on these beats, MCs don't see me\nBelieve me, BET and MTV\nAre gonna grieve when we leave, dog, fo' sheezy\nCan't leave rap alone, the game needs me\n'Til we grow beards, get weird and disappear\nInto the mountains, nothin' but clowns down here\nBut we ain't fuckin' around round here\nYo, Dre (What up?) Can I get a \"hell yeah\"? (Hell yeah!)\n\n[Hook: Eminem]\nNow let's get down to business\nI don't got no time to play around, what is this?\nMust be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down\nOn these clowns; can I get a witness?
